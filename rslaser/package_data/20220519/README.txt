Note: we have different resolutions for two files in the may dataset

Pump (“Revo”)
- (pump off data?)
- Old file: RevoImage.tif
- New file:
- w0 = 1.43mm, I ~ exp(-2r^2/w0^2)
- 4.2 microns per pixel

Seed (‘Regen’) 
- (off peak timing?)
- Old file: RegenImage.tif
- New file: 
- w0 = 1.88mm
- 4.13 microns per pixel

# These files also don't have a header (add in later?)
